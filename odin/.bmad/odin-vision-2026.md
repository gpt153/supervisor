# Odin Vision 2026: Complete Life Management System

**Created:** 2026-01-15
**Status:** Active Planning
**Timeline:** 10-month phased rollout (Feb-Nov 2026)
**Owner:** Samuel

---

## Executive Summary

Odin is not just an AI assistant - it's your **second brain** and **digital nervous system**. A JARVIS-like intelligence that manages your entire digital life: communications across all platforms, family coordination for 5 kids, proactive time management, autonomous web interactions, universal shopping assistance, and comprehensive knowledge management across all your files and drives.

**Core Philosophy:** Intelligence over automation. Odin doesn't just execute tasks - it understands context, learns patterns, anticipates needs, and makes smart decisions on your behalf.

---

## The Complete Vision

### 1. Universal Communications Hub

**All communication flows through Odin:**
- Email (Gmail, multiple accounts)
- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Facebook Messenger
- Snapchat
- SMS/MMS

**Intelligent Message Management:**
- **Unified Inbox:** All messages in one interface, searchable across platforms
- **Smart Filtering:** Urgent vs can-wait based on sender, content, context
- **Batched Notifications:** "You have 3 messages and 2 emails that require attention"
- **Priority Learning:** Learns who is always urgent (school, partner, kids' caregivers)
- **Context-Aware Delivery:** Delays non-urgent messages until appropriate time
- **Unified Search:** "Show me all communication about Oliver's dental appointment" (across ALL platforms)
- **Cross-Platform Responses:** Draft responses that match platform style (formal for email, casual for WhatsApp)

**Example Flow:**
```
9:00am - Work focus time
- Emma's teacher messages on Messenger → Odin holds it (can wait)
- Partner texts on WhatsApp → Odin holds it (not urgent)
- School calls about sick child → Odin interrupts immediately (urgent)

11:00am - Break time
Odin (voice): "You have 5 messages from break time:
- Emma's teacher about field trip (needs response by Friday)
- Your partner about dinner plans
- 3 casual messages from friends
Want to review them now or later?"
```

---

### 2. Family Context Engine (5 Kids)

**The Core of Odin's Intelligence:**

**Child Profiles:**
- 2 biological children
- 3 foster children
- Each with complete digital profile:
  - Name, age, nicknames, pronouns
  - School, teachers, friends
  - Activities, schedules, routines
  - Medical info, allergies, medications
  - Preferences, interests, behavioral patterns

**Automatic Entity Recognition:**
- Any email, message, document, or scanned file mentioning a child → auto-tagged
- "Emma's dentist appointment" → Filed under Emma → Healthcare → Dentist
- Understands relationships: "Mrs. Anderson" is Emma's teacher
- Tracks important people per child: teachers, doctors, coaches, friends' parents

**School Integration (Quiculum MCP):**
- Real-time feed from school portal (3 kids)
- News, messages, elevanteckningar (student notes)
- Schedule changes, early dismissals
- Auto-creates calendar events
- Proactive reminders: "Library day tomorrow for Oliver"

**Privacy Levels:**
- Foster children have elevated privacy protections
- Case worker communications isolated
- Separate encryption for sensitive foster care documents
- Transition planning documentation

**Example Intelligence:**
```
Email arrives: "Emma's dental appointment confirmed for Jan 22 at 3pm"

Odin automatically:
1. Recognizes "Emma" entity
2. Extracts appointment details
3. Creates calendar event
4. Checks for conflicts (Oliver has soccer at 3:30pm)
5. Alerts: "Emma dentist conflicts with Oliver soccer. Need to adjust?"
6. Files email under: Emma → Healthcare → Dental
7. Sets reminder: 1 day before + 1 hour before
8. Updates Emma's health timeline
```

### 3. Time Management & Scheduling Intelligence

**Odin as Your Productivity Coach:**

**Pattern Learning (2-4 weeks of data):**
- Identifies productive hours (e.g., 9-11am, 2-4pm)
- Tracks energy levels by day/time
- Measures focus capacity and context-switch cost
- Learns procrastination patterns
- Understands work preferences

**Proactive Weekly Planning:**
```
Sunday 7pm - Planning Session:

Odin: "Ready to plan your week? I've noticed:
- You haven't done accounting in 2 weeks (usually Fridays)
- You've spent 90% of time on Houseboat project
- Bills due Wednesday (1,245 SEK Vattenfall)
- Emma: dentist Tuesday 3pm, soccer Thursday
- Oliver: gym clothes needed Tuesday, library books due
- Jonas: foster care check-in Friday

Suggested schedule:
Monday:
  9-11am: Houseboat (deep work, high energy)
  2-4pm: Client work (admin tasks, lower energy)
  4pm: Pick up kids

Tuesday:
  9-12pm: New app project (balance your focus)
  3pm: Emma dentist
  Evening: Help Oliver with library books

Wednesday:
  9-10am: Pay bills (before deadline)
  10-12pm: Houseboat project
  Afternoon: Family time

Thursday:
  9-11am: Deep work (your choice)
  3pm: Emma soccer practice
  Evening: Foster care paperwork prep

Friday:
  2-4pm: Accounting (overdue!)
  4-5pm: Week review

This gives you:
- 40% Houseboat, 30% Client work, 20% Admin, 10% Family tasks
- Accounting gets done (finally!)
- All kids' needs covered
- Matches your energy patterns

Should I block this in calendar?"
```

**Daily Check-ins:**
- Morning briefing with weather, schedule, reminders
- Mid-day check: "You've been on Houseboat for 4 hours, time to switch?"
- Evening review: "You completed accounting! 8 tasks done today."

**Balance Enforcement:**
- Tracks time per project/activity
- Prevents over-focus on single project
- Ensures recurring tasks get done (accounting, bills)
- Minimizes context switching (batches similar tasks)

**Recurring Task Management:**
- Accounting (weekly, Fridays)
- Bill payment (monthly, first week)
- Weekly planning (Sundays)
- School prep (Sunday evenings)
- Auto-schedules with reminders
- Detects when you're procrastinating

### 4. Project Memory & Context Switching

**Long-Term Conversational Memory:**

**Project-Based Context:**
- Every major initiative is a "project" with persistent memory
- Examples: Houseboat Renovation, New App Development, Coffee Shop Brand
- Each project maintains:
  - Conversation history (weeks/months)
  - Related files, emails, documents
  - Related people and entities
  - Key decisions made
  - Next steps and action items

**Seamless Context Switching:**
```
You: "Help me draft email to marina about houseboat"
Odin: [Uses email context, drafts email]

You: "But now I want to talk about the houseboat project"
Odin: "Switching to Houseboat Renovation project.

Last conversation: 3 days ago, we discussed electrical system.
You decided on marine-grade wiring (€3,500 quote from electrician).

Status:
- Plumbing: 80% complete
- Electrical: Waiting on materials
- Interior: Planning phase
- Budget: €12,000 spent of €25,000

You need to order:
- 50m marine cable (found on Biltema, 749 SEK)
- Waterproof junction boxes
- LED fixtures

What would you like to work on?"
```

**Cross-Project Intelligence:**

- **Estimated Cost:** €200-500/month at full scale

**2. Privacy Breach**
- **Risk:** Foster care data extremely sensitive
- **Mitigation:** Encryption at rest, separate database, audit logs, no cloud storage
- **Compliance:** GDPR, Swedish foster care regulations

**3. Integration Reliability**
- **Risk:** External APIs can change or break
- **Mitigation:** Robust error handling, fallbacks, graceful degradation
- **Monitoring:** Health checks on all integrations

**4. Context Window Limitations**
- **Risk:** LLMs have token limits
- **Mitigation:** Intelligent summarization, chunking, context prioritization
- **Solution:** RAG architecture + smart context loading

**5. User Burnout (Irony Alert)**
- **Risk:** Too many features = overwhelm
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout, user can disable features, progressive disclosure
- **Philosophy:** Start simple, add complexity gradually

---

## Key Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

### ADR-003: MCP Architecture for External Integrations
**Decision:** Use Model Context Protocol for all marketplace and external service integrations
**Rationale:** Isolation, reusability, security, independent updates

### ADR-004: OpenAI Realtime API for Voice
**Decision:** Use OpenAI Realtime API instead of separate STT/TTS
**Rationale:** Lower latency, better quality, built-in turn detection, despite higher cost

### ADR-005: Project-Based Context Management
**Decision:** Organize all information by projects rather than purely chronological
**Rationale:** Matches how humans think about work, enables context switching, long-term memory

### ADR-006: Playwright MCP for Browser Automation
**Decision:** Use existing Playwright MCP instead of custom Selenium
**Rationale:** Already available, well-maintained, security controls built-in

### ADR-007: Separate Privacy Tier for Foster Children
**Decision:** Foster child data gets elevated encryption and access controls
**Rationale:** Legal requirements, ethical responsibility, sensitive case information

---
