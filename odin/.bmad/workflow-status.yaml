      MAJOR SCOPE EXPANSION beyond initial MVP:
      - Family context engine for 5 kids
      - Time management and scheduling intelligence
      - Project-based memory system
      - Voice interface (ChatGPT Voice Mode equivalent)
      - Browser automation (Playwright MCP)
      - Marketplace integrations (Amazon, Temu, Blocket, etc.)
      - Universal knowledge base (all files, all drives)

      Planning track upgraded to "enterprise" due to complexity.
      10-phase roadmap created (10 months).

      - OpenAI Realtime API for voice interface
      - Project-based context management for long-term memory

      Technology stack finalized:
      - Python 3.11+ / FastAPI / PostgreSQL+pgvector / Redis+Celery
      - Claude Sonnet 4.5 (reasoning) + GPT-4 (specific tasks)
      - OpenAI Realtime API (voice)
      - MCP servers (Quiculum, marketplaces, Playwright)

# Notes and Context
notes: |
  MAJOR PLANNING SESSION: 2026-01-15

  Expanded Odin from simple email assistant to complete life management system.

  Key Features Added:
  - Family context engine (5 kids, 2 biological + 3 foster)
  - Time management intelligence (pattern learning, weekly planning)
  - Project-based memory (long-term conversations, context switching)
  - Voice interface (ChatGPT Voice Mode equivalent)
  - Browser automation (autonomous web tasks)
  - Marketplace integrations (universal shopping assistant)
  - Universal knowledge base (all files, all drives, OCR)

  Critical for Success:
  1. Family context (core differentiator)
  2. Time management (productivity coach)
  3. Project memory (makes interactions natural)
  4. Voice (accessibility and hands-free)

  Privacy Considerations:
  - Foster children data requires elevated privacy (Level 2)
  - Encryption at rest
  - Audit logging
  - GDPR compliance

  Timeline:
  - Phase 1 (MVP): Feb 2026 (4 weeks)
  - Phase 2-10: Mar-Nov 2026 (9 months)
  - Total: 10 months to complete vision

  Next Steps:
  - Finish remaining epic documentation
  - Begin Phase 1 implementation (early Feb)
  - Weekly reviews to track progress
