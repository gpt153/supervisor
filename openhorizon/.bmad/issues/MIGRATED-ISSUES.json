    "body": "# Brainstorming Playground: Vision Document\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Brainstorming Playground is a creative ideation space that exists before formal project planning. It's where sparks of inspiration become seeds of possibility, where vague feelings transform into concrete concepts, and where creative exploration happens without commitment.\n\n## The Problem\n\nCurrently, users face a gap between having an idea and creating a project. There's no space for:\n- **Exploration without commitment** - Sometimes you want to explore ideas without immediately committing to a full project\n- **Creative generation** - Getting inspired by AI-generated possibilities based on mood, theme, or feeling\n- **Idea storage** - Keeping interesting concepts for later without cluttering your active projects\n- **Iterative refinement** - Taking a rough concept and collaboratively developing it before formalizing\n\nThe current flow forces users to either:\n1. Start a project immediately (too much commitment for uncertain ideas)\n2. Keep ideas in their head or external notes (disconnected from the system)\n\n## The Solution: A Three-Phase Journey\n\n### Phase 1: The Seed Factory (Generation)\n\n**What it is:**\nA creative prompt interface where inspiration meets possibility.\n\n**The experience:**\nYou arrive at the Seed Factory with a feeling, a mood, a theme - anything from \"something warm and adventurous with lots of movement\" to \"a project about rediscovering childhood wonder\" to \"minimal, zen, focused on breath.\"\n\nYou adjust two controls:\n- **Number of seeds** (default 10) - How many ideas do you want to explore?\n- **Temperature** (creativity level) - How wild or conventional should the ideas be?\n\nYou submit your prompt, and the AI generates seeds - each one a potential project, complete with:\n- A compelling title\n- A 1-2 paragraph description written in informal, engaging language\n- An \"approval likelihood\" indicator showing how feasible this seed is\n\nYou browse through these seeds. Some resonate immediately. Some spark curiosity. Some you dismiss. You save the ones that intrigue you - not as commitments, but as possibilities.\n\nYou can repeat this process endlessly. Generate seeds based on different moods, themes, constraints. Build a collection of \"what ifs.\"\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- **Reduces friction** - Ideation becomes playful, not pressured\n- **Sparks creativity** - AI suggestions you might never have thought of yourself\n- **No commitment** - Explore freely without filling your project list with uncertainties\n- **Serendipity** - Sometimes the best ideas come from unexpected combinations\n\n### Phase 2: The Seed Garden (Storage)\n\n**What it is:**\nA personal collection of all the seeds you've saved - your idea greenhouse.\n\n**The experience:**\nYou navigate to the Seed Garden and see all your saved seeds displayed in an organized, visually appealing way. Each seed shows its title, a snippet of its description, and its approval likelihood meter.\n\nYou can browse, sort, filter - rediscovering ideas you saved weeks ago that now feel more relevant, or stumbling upon a forgotten seed that suddenly clicks with your current situation.\n\nWhen a seed catches your attention, you click on it to enter the elaboration space.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- **Persistent memory** - Ideas don't get lost in the chaos of daily life\n- **Discovery** - Rediscover old ideas with fresh eyes\n- **Organization** - Keep creative possibilities separate from active projects\n- **Permission to dream** - A dedicated space for \"someday maybe\" ideas\n\n### Phase 3: Seed Elaboration (Refinement)\n\n**What it is:**\nA hybrid workspace where you and the AI collaboratively develop a seed into something ready to become a project.\n\n**The experience:**\nThe screen splits into two spaces:\n\n**Top: The Living Preview**\nThe seed displayed in its current form - title, description, tags, approval likelihood. This is the \"now\" state of your idea. You can see it evolve in real-time.\n\n**Bottom: The Conversation**\nA chat interface with the AI where the real magic happens. You can:\n- Ask for changes: \"Make it more mysterious\"\n- Request additions: \"Add a time travel element\"\n- Seek suggestions: \"What would make this more engaging?\"\n- Direct edit: \"Change the setting to a coastal town\"\n\nThe AI responds with suggestions, each accompanied by an \"Apply\" button. When you apply a suggestion, the preview updates immediately, and the change is recorded in the conversation history.\n\nYou can also directly edit the preview at any time - the AI sees these changes and incorporates them into its understanding for future suggestions.\n\n**The evolution:**\nAs you refine the seed, the approval likelihood meter adjusts, reflecting how the changes affect feasibility. You're not locked into the original concept - the seed can grow, transform, even become something entirely different through collaboration.\n\n**The transition:**\nWhen the seed feels ready - when it's evolved from a vague feeling into a concrete vision - you click \"Turn into Project.\" The system takes all the information you've developed and pre-fills the project creation flow. You're now moving from imagination to execution.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- **Collaborative creativity** - AI as creative partner, not just executor\n- **Visible evolution** - See how the idea transforms through conversation\n- **Flexibility** - Mix conversational exploration with direct editing\n- **Seamless transition** - From seed to project without information loss\n- **No pressure** - Elaborate at your own pace, save and return anytime\n\n## The User Journey\n\n**Discovery Phase:**\n1. User feels inspired, curious, or creatively stuck\n2. Navigates to \"Seed Factory\"\n3. Enters a mood-based prompt\n4. Adjusts generation settings (quantity, creativity)\n5. Reviews generated seeds\n6. Saves interesting ones to the Garden\n\n**Storage Phase:**\n1. User navigates to \"Seed Garden\"\n2. Browses saved seeds\n3. Rediscovers forgotten ideas\n4. Selects a seed to elaborate\n\n**Refinement Phase:**\n1. Seed opens in elaboration interface\n2. User and AI collaborate through conversation\n3. Seed evolves through applied suggestions and direct edits\n4. Approval likelihood updates with changes\n5. When satisfied, user clicks \"Turn into Project\"\n\n**Transition Phase:**\n1. Project creation flow opens\n2. All seed information pre-filled\n3. User completes any additional required fields\n4. Project is created and moves into the main project workflow\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### Playful, Not Pressured\nThe entire experience should feel like creative play, not work. There's no obligation to turn seeds into projects. Exploring is valuable in itself.\n\n### Informal and Engaging\nAll language throughout the experience uses informal tone (consistent with the site's existing style). Descriptions should feel conversational, exciting, human.\n\n### Visual Feedback\nThe approval likelihood meter provides instant, visual feedback about feasibility. Users shouldn't need to guess whether an idea is achievable.\n\n### Persistent Context\nEverything is saved. You can leave a seed half-elaborated and return days later - the conversation history, the current state, everything is preserved.\n\n### Seamless Integration\nWhile the Seed Factory and Garden are distinct spaces from the main project area, the transition from seed to project should feel natural and effortless.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nA successful Brainstorming Playground means:\n- Users regularly generate seeds for exploration, not just when they have concrete project ideas\n- Seeds get refined over multiple sessions (indicating users return to elaborate)\n- A healthy mix of seeds become projects (some) while others remain in the garden (most)\n- Users discover unexpected project directions through AI suggestions\n- The approval likelihood meter helps users make informed decisions about feasibility\n- The barrier between \"vague idea\" and \"actionable project\" feels lower\n\n## What This Is Not\n\nThis is **not**:\n- A replacement for the project planner (that's for execution)\n- A formal requirements gathering tool (it's for inspiration)\n- A task management system (it's for ideation)\n- Meant to force every seed into becoming a project (most won't, and that's okay)\n\n## The Why\n\n**Why build this?**\n\nBecause creativity doesn't start with a concrete plan. It starts with a feeling, a curiosity, a \"what if?\" The current system expects users to arrive with clarity, but the best ideas often emerge from exploration.\n\nThis feature gives users permission to dream, to explore, to play with possibilities without the weight of commitment. It acknowledges that the journey from inspiration to project is itself valuable - and that journey deserves its own dedicated space.\n\nBy making ideation playful, collaborative, and persistent, we lower the barrier to creativity. We create a space where users can have ten wild ideas, save two interesting ones, elaborate on one over time, and eventually - when it's ready - transform it into something real.\n\nThat's the magic: turning whispers of inspiration into seeds of possibility, and nurturing those seeds until they're ready to grow into full projects.",

Observe 500 error\n\n**Reproduction Rate:** 100%\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n- When projectId is provided without phaseId, fetch project context differently\n- Use `prisma.project.findUnique()` with `include: { phases: true }` instead\n- Only call `prisma.phase.findUnique()` when phaseId is explicitly provided\n\n## Fix Strategy\n\n1. Add conditional logic to check if phaseId exists\n2. If only projectId: Use `prisma.project.findUnique({ where: { id: projectId }, include: { phases: true } })`\n3.

    "body": "## Overview\n\nTransform the seed elaboration process from a manual, blank-canvas experience into an **intelligent, AI-driven requirements-gathering conversation** that automatically generates complete project skeletons.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\n**Current State**:\n- Seeds have minimal info\n- Seed elaboration returns errors\n- Converting seed → project creates empty structure\n- Users must manually create each phase\n- No guidance on timeline, budget, or requirements\n- High friction = abandoned projects\n\n**Desired State**:\n- AI acts as expert project consultant\n- Conversational requirements gathering with Q&A\n- Auto-generates complete project skeleton with phases\n- Timeline calculated from duration/dates\n- Budget allocated across phases\n- Checklists pre-filled (visas, permits, insurance)\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Conversational Seed Elaboration\n- AI asks progressive questions (participants, budget, duration, destination, etc.)\n- Natural language responses (no rigid forms)\n- Intelligent suggestions when user doesn't know\n- Validation against Erasmus+ requirements\n\n### 2. Rich Metadata Collection\n```typescript\nmetadata: {\n  participantCount: 30,\n  participantCountries: [\"Sweden\", \"Turkey\"],\n  totalBudget: 15000,\n  destination: { country: \"Spain\", city: \"Barcelona\" },\n  requirements: {\n    visas: [{ country: \"Turkey\", needed: true }],\n    insurance: true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Automatic Project Generation\n- **Timeline Generation**: Calculate phases based on duration/dates\n- **Budget Allocation**: Intelligently distribute (30% travel, 25% accommodation, etc.)\n- **Phase Generation**: Create phases with templates (Travel, Food, Accommodation, etc.)\n- **Checklist Auto-population**: Generate task lists per phase\n\n### 4. AI Agent Integration\n- Agents pre-seeded with project context\n- Phase-specific agents ready to work (Travel, Food, Accommodation)\n- Results saved directly to phases\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### New Backend Modules Needed\n1. `seed-elaboration-agent.ts` - Conversational AI for requirements gathering\n2. `project-generator.ts` - Orchestrates auto-generation from seed\n3. `timeline-generator.ts` - Calculates phase dates and dependencies\n4. `budget-allocator.ts` - Distributes budget intelligently\n5. `requirements-analyzer.ts` - Identifies visas, permits, insurance needs\n\n### Database Schema Changes\n- Add `metadata` JSONB column to `seed` table\n- Add `checklist` JSONB column to `phase` table\n- Add `auto_generated` boolean to `phase` table\n\n## Success Metrics\n- **Time to First Project**: < 15 minutes (from idea to complete project)\n- **Seed Completion Rate**: > 80% (seeds that get converted)\n- **User Satisfaction**: > 4.5/5\n\n## Documentation\nFull PRD available at: `/project-pipeline/PRD-INTELLIGENT-SEED-ELABORATION.md`\n\n## Implementation Phases\n1. ✅ Fix current bugs (seed elaboration, phase validation) - DONE\n2. Conversational seed elaboration (2 weeks)\n3. Project generation engine (2 weeks)\n4. Enhanced phase management (1 week)\n5. AI agent integration (1 week)\n6. Testing & refinement (1 week)\n\n---\n\n@scar Please create a detailed implementation plan for this feature using `/plan-feature-github`. Consider:\n- Current codebase patterns\n- Existing seed/project/phase architecture\n- Integration with current AI agents (Travel, Food, Accommodation)\n- Database migrations needed\n- Frontend/backend changes required",
