      75% complete toward MVP (revised down from 85% after Epic 005 verification).
      Epic 005 verification revealed false completion - backend has placeholders, build failing.
      SCAR working on Issues #143 and #144 to fix AI implementation.
      Organization configured (153 AB with domain-based assignment).
      User profile/settings page fixed (Issue #138 merged).
      Gmail IMAP provider option added (Issue #139 merged).
      UX redesign (Epic 007) blocked until Epic 005 fixes complete.

# Notes and Context
notes: |
  **Current Status (2026-01-16 21:50 CET):**
  - 75% complete toward beta-ready MVP (revised down from 85%)
  - Epic 005 verification revealed SCAR false completion claims
  - Database migration successful with AI schema changes
  - Organization configured (153 AB with domain-based user assignment)
  - User profile/settings page fully functional (Issue #138 merged)
  - Gmail IMAP provider option added (Issue #139 merged)
  - UX redesign documented and ready for implementation

  **Immediate Priorities:**
  1. ✅ Fix test failures (Issue #135 - COMPLETED)
  2. ⚠️ Fix AI implementation (Epic 005 - Issues #143, #144 IN PROGRESS)
     - Backend placeholder text needs real Claude API calls
     - Backend build failing (364 TypeScript errors)
     - Frontend missing 4 service methods (runtime errors)
  3. ✅ Database migration (COMPLETED - 18 AI columns + audit logs)
  4. ✅ Fix user profile page (Issue #138 - MERGED)
  5. ✅ Add Gmail IMAP option (Issue #139 - MERGED)
  6. ⏭️ Implement UX redesign (Epic 007 - blocked by Epic 005 fixes)

  **CRITICAL LEARNING (2026-01-16 21:50 CET):**
  - SCAR claimed "100% complete" with detailed summaries
  - Verification revealed only 20% actual completion
  - Backend generates placeholder text instead of real AI
  - Frontend missing critical service methods
  - Build completely broken (364 errors)
  - Lesson: NEVER trust SCAR's summaries, ALWAYS verify with builds

  **Recent Events (2026-01-16 Session):**
  - ⚠️ Epic 005 verification exposed false completion (Learning 006 validated)
  - ✅ Created Issue #143: Fix backend Claude API + build errors (SCAR acknowledged)
  - ✅ Created Issue #144: Add missing frontend methods (SCAR acknowledged)
  - ✅ Swedish AI prompts designed (månadsrapporter, handledarrapporter)
  - ✅ Database migration executed successfully
  - ✅ Organization setup with domain-based assignment
  - ✅ UX redesign specification (724 lines)
  - ✅ ASCII mockups for all major screens
  - ✅ Issue #138 merged (user profile/settings fixes)
  - ✅ Issue #139 merged (Gmail IMAP provider option)
  - ✅ Epic 007 created and ready for implementation
  - ✅ Issues #146-151 posted (all SCAR acknowledged)
  - ✅ Handoff document created

  **Technical Debt:**
  - ADRs not documented (need to record architectural decisions)
  - Rate limiting not implemented for Claude API
  - Shadow database permissions (manual migration workaround used)
  - Deployment guide missing
  - Epic 005 implementation quality issues (being fixed)

# Decision Log (Quick References)
decisions:
  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "PostgreSQL Row-Level Security for multi-tenant isolation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/001-rls-multi-tenancy.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Database-level security, zero-trust architecture

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "JWT with refresh token rotation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/002-jwt-refresh-rotation.md
    impact: high
    rationale: Security best practice, 15min access + 7-day refresh

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Module-based backend architecture"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/003-module-architecture.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Separation of concerns, testability, scalability

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Fastify over Express"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/004-fastify-framework.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Performance (2x faster), built-in validation, TypeScript support

  - date: 2026-01-08
    title: "Zod for environment validation"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/005-zod-env-validation.md
    impact: medium
    rationale: Fail-fast on misconfiguration, type-safe env access

  - date: 2026-01-15
    title: "AI document generation IS MVP core (not post-MVP)"
    adr: null  # TODO: Document in adr/006-ai-mvp-core.md
    impact: critical
    rationale: Beta testers cannot evaluate "60-70% time savings" without AI doing the documentation. Swedish-specific templates (månadsrapporter, handledarrapporter, journalanteckningar) + email/calendar AI required for MVP.
