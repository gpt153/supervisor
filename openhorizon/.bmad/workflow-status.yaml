# Notes and Context
notes: |
  **Current Status (2026-01-18 05:00 CET):**

  ⚠️ CRITICAL INCIDENT: Previous supervisor spent 2 days working on WRONG codebase
  - Worked on Epic 003 (Production Readiness) for /app directory
  - /app was OLD and DISCARDED Next.js platform
  - User wanted work on /project-pipeline ONLY
  - Result: 11 issues (#154-162) completed on wrong codebase
  - Cost: 2 days + significant API costs

  **Corrective Actions Taken:**
  - Archived /app to .archive/old-app-NEVER-USE/
  - Archived /landing to .archive/landing/
  - Created WARNING-DO-NOT-USE.md in archive
  - Updated all documentation to ONLY reference project-pipeline
  - Committed archive changes to git

  **Current Task (2026-01-18):**
  Implement intelligent seed elaboration per PRD:
  - Conversational AI requirements gathering
  - Auto-generate complete project skeletons
  - Pre-populated phases (Travel, Food, Accommodation, Activities)
  - Calculated timelines and budget allocation
  - Pre-filled checklists (visas, permits, insurance)

  **Repository Structure:**
  - Implementation: /home/samuel/.archon/workspaces/openhorizon.cc/project-pipeline/
  - Planning: /home/samuel/supervisor/openhorizon/
  - Archived (DO NOT USE): .archive/old-app-NEVER-USE/, .archive/landing/

    2026-01-18 Review:
    - Discovered 2-day wasted effort on wrong codebase
    - Archived old app to prevent future confusion
    - Refocused ONLY on project-pipeline
    - Current task: Intelligent seed elaboration feature
