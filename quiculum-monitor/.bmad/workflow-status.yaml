    notes: |
      Researched Quiculum portal structure and authentication flow.
      Identified Google SSO requirement and JavaScript rendering.
      Determined web scraping is only viable approach (no API).

    notes: |
      Created PRD with user personas and requirements.
      Broke down into single epic (core monitoring system).
      Applied MoSCoW prioritization (all features MUST for v1).
      Documented retroactively after implementation.

    notes: |
      Documented 5 key architecture decisions with rationale.
      ADR-001: Selenium for browser automation (handles Google SSO + JS rendering)
      ADR-002: Cookie persistence (avoid rate limiting, improve performance)
      ADR-003: Docker containerization (portability, dependency management)
      ADR-004: JSON files vs database (simplicity for single-user system)
      ADR-005: Multiple scheduling options (flexibility for different users)

    github_issues: []  # No GitHub issues used (direct implementation)
    notes: |
      Implemented all core features:
      - Google SSO authentication with session cookie persistence
      - Data extraction (news, messages, elevanteckningar)
      - Change detection (compare with previous run)
      - JSON storage with timestamped snapshots
      - Headless Chrome operation
      - Docker containerization (two variants)
      - Three scheduling options (Docker cron, host cron, launchd)
      - Comprehensive error handling
      All acceptance criteria met. Ready for testing with real credentials.

    notes: |
      Manual testing completed for all features (with test data).
      Real-world testing blocked: Requires production Quiculum credentials.
      Target: 30 days of automated runs with 95%+ success rate.
      Next steps: Deploy with real credentials, monitor for errors.

# Notes and Context
notes: |
  Project Status (2026-01-17):
  - Implementation: 90% complete (all code written, tested with mock data)
  - Documentation: 100% complete (README, QUICKSTART, DOCKER, BMAD artifacts)
  - Testing: 50% complete (manual testing done, real-world testing pending)
  - Blocker: Needs production Quiculum credentials for final validation

  Retrospective Documentation:
  - BMAD artifacts created retroactively on 2026-01-17
  - Implementation was completed before planning docs were written
  - Epic, ADRs, and PRD document decisions made during development

  Next Steps:
  1. Deploy with real Quiculum credentials
  2. Run 30 days of automated monitoring (9 AM and 6 PM daily)
  3. Monitor for errors (HTML changes, session expiry, rate limiting)
  4. Plan future enhancements (notifications, RAG integration, web dashboard)
