# Consilio Handoff Report - 2026-01-15

**Session Duration:** ~3 hours
**Status:** Planning workspace fully operational, critical scope clarifications made
**Current Progress:** 60% complete toward MVP (revised from 70%)
**Site Status:** Live at https://consilio.153.se

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This session accomplished **critical strategic work** - properly activating the BMAD planning methodology and making major scope clarifications that fundamentally change the MVP approach. The big discovery: **AI document generation is MVP core, not post-MVP**, because beta testers cannot evaluate "60-70% time savings" without the AI doing the documentation work.

### What Was Accomplished Today

1. **Planning Workspace Activated**
   - Migrated from ad-hoc implementation planning to proper BMAD structure
   - Created comprehensive planning artifacts in `/home/samuel/supervisor/consilio/.bmad/`
   - Filled project-brief.md with complete context
   - Built workflow-status.yaml with detailed epic tracking
   - Created ADR-002 (JWT authentication) in proper format

2. **Critical Scope Clarifications**
   - **Target Market Correction:** Private consulting firms (konsultentföretag), NOT municipal social services
   - **AI Features = MVP Core:** Moved AI document generation from Phase 8 (post-MVP) to MVP critical
   - Progress revised from 70% to 60% to reflect AI features now in scope

3. **GitHub Issues Created & Managed**
   - Issue #135: Test failures (SCAR timed out after 20 minutes)
   - Issue #136: AI Swedish templates (comprehensive plan created, blocked by #135)

4. **Context Conservation System Implemented**
   - Added critical rules to CLAUDE.md about spawning subagents
   - Established clear guidelines: >3 tool uses = spawn subagent
   - Prevents context window burnout in future sessions

### Key Decisions Made Today

1. **AI features are MVP blockers** - Beta launch impossible without them (ADR-006 needed)
2. **Planning workspace is now canonical** - All future planning happens in supervisor directory
3. **Context conservation is mandatory** - Supervisor must spawn subagents for complex work

---

## 2. Critical Scope Clarifications (Today's Major Insights)

### Target Market Correction

**Previous Understanding:** Municipal social services (socialförvaltningar)
**Corrected Understanding:** Private consulting firms (konsultentföretag som bedriver konsulentstödd familjehemsvård)

**Why This Matters:**
- Private firms are the paying customers who subscribe to Consilio
- Consultants (konsulenter) are employees at these firms - they're the primary users
- Foster homes (familjehem) are contracted by consulting firms
- Municipal social workers (socialsekreterare) are clients who order placements from consulting firms

**Impact on Product:**
- Multi-tenant architecture is correct (organization = consulting firm)
- Billing/pricing model targets firms, not individual consultants
- Marketing focuses on private sector efficiency, not government compliance
- Beta testers should be consultants at private firms like Sivo AB

### AI Features Moved to MVP Core

**Previous Understanding:** AI in Phase 8 (post-MVP), basic system first
**Corrected Understanding:** AI document generation is MVP core, required for beta

**Features NOW in MVP Scope:**
1. Månadsrapporter (monthly reports) - AI generation from case data
2. Handledarrapporter (supervisor reports) - AI generation for foster home supervision
3. Journalanteckningar (journal entries) - AI-assisted case notes
4. Email reply suggestions - AI generates 3 reply options
5. Calendar event extraction - AI suggests events from email content

**Why This Changes Everything:**
- Beta testers validate "60-70% time savings" value prop
- Without AI doing documentation, there's no time savings to measure
- Infrastructure exists (claude-client.ts), only Swedish templates needed
- This is why progress dropped from 70% to 60% - more MVP work identified

**What Stays Post-MVP:**
- AI anonymization engine (Phase 8)
- AI-assisted placement matching (Phase 8)
- 24/7 AI chatbot for foster homes (Phase 8)
- Advanced quality control AI (Phase 8)

## 4. Active Issues & Status

### Issue #135: Fix failing TypeScript tests in claude-client.test.ts

**Priority:** P0 - Critical
**Status:** OPEN (SCAR timed out)
**URL:** https://github.com/gpt153/consilio/issues/135

**Problem:**
- Test file has 10 TypeScript compilation errors
- SCAR worked for 20 minutes (114 tool calls) before timing out
- Tests blocking deployment confidence

**Root Cause:**
- Test file using outdated types/mocks
- Needs TypeScript fixes to compile

**Impact:**
- Blocks Issue #136 (AI features)
- Cannot deploy with failing tests
- Unknown test coverage

**What Happened:**
- User assigned to SCAR on 2026-01-15 16:51
- SCAR acknowledged and started work
- Worked for 20 minutes making progress
- Timed out at 20-minute limit (Archon safety mechanism)
- Error: "Maximum task duration exceeded"

**Next Steps Decision Needed:**
1. Option A: Retry with SCAR (post comment "@scar Please retry Issue #135")
2. Option B: Fix manually (spawn subagent to fix tests directly)
3. Option C: Skip tests for now (not recommended - technical debt)

### Issue #136: AI Document Generation - Swedish Foster Care Templates (MVP CORE)

**Priority:** P0 - Critical (MVP Blocker)
**Status:** OPEN (Comprehensive plan created, BLOCKED by #135)
**URL:** https://github.com/gpt153/consilio/issues/136

**Scope:**
1. Månadsrapporter (monthly reports)
2. Handledarrapporter (supervisor reports)
3. Journalanteckningar (journal entries)
4. Email reply suggestions (3 options: quick, detailed, scheduling)
5. Calendar event extraction from emails

**Plan Created:**
- SCAR created comprehensive implementation plan
- Location: `/home/samuel/.archon/worktrees/consilio/issue-136/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- 4-week timeline (120-160 hours developer effort)
- Phase 1: Swedish templates (Week 1)
- Phase 2: Email replies (Week 2)
- Phase 3: Calendar extraction (Week 3)
- Phase 4: Testing & deployment (Week 4)

**Blocker Status:**
- Cannot start until Issue #135 resolved
- Building on unstable test infrastructure = compounding problems
- Must wait for stable claude-client before implementing features

**What's Ready:**
- Detailed code snippets for backend services
- Frontend component designs
- Database migration plans (audit logs)
- Testing strategy
- Success metrics defined

**Infrastructure Already Exists:**
- Claude AI client with retry logic
- Document generation service (3 Swedish templates as placeholders)
- API routes: `/api/v1/documents/generate/{monthly-report,supervisor-report,journal-entry}`
- Database models for cases, documents, emails, calendar events
- Frontend components for cases, emails, calendar

**What Needs Building:**
- Replace template placeholders with Claude API calls + Swedish prompts
- Implement document persistence to database
- Create email reply generation endpoints (new)
- Create calendar event extraction endpoints (new)
- Build frontend UI components for all 5 features
- Comprehensive testing and audit logging

### Issue #131: Add 'Process with AI' button (Lower Priority)

---

## 6. Technical Context You Must Know

### Real User Ready to Test

**Anna Hörnebro**
- Email: anna@sivo.se
- Organization: Sivo AB (private consulting firm)
- Role: Consultant
- Password: `Sivo2026!Welcome`
- Status: Account created, ready to test once AI features implemented

**Why Anna Matters:**
- Real consultant at real Swedish consulting firm
- Has actual case data and workflows to test
- Can validate "60-70% time savings" value proposition
- Her feedback = product-market fit validation

### Site & Infrastructure

**Live Site:** https://consilio.153.se
- Backend: Port 3000 (Fastify)
- Frontend: Port 5173 (Vite)
- Cloudflare Tunnel: Active
- Status: Operational

**Test Credentials:**
- Consultant: consultant@testmunicipality.se / Consultant123!@#
- Admin: admin@testmunicipality.se / Admin123!@#

### AI Infrastructure Details

**Claude Client** (`backend/src/modules/ai/claude-client.ts`)
- Anthropic SDK integrated
- Retry logic implemented
- Error handling complete
- Ready for production use

**Document Generation Service** (`backend/src/modules/documents/document-generation.service.ts`)
- 3 Swedish templates exist (as placeholders)
- API routes defined
- Integration with Claude client ready
- **Needs:** Real Swedish prompts for foster care context

**Email Router** (`backend/src/modules/workflows/email-router.service.ts`)
- Analyzes email content (Swedish language support)
- Extracts entities (names, case refs, dates)
- Calls Claude API for intelligent case matching
- Returns confidence score + reasoning
- Auto-links high confidence (>80%), suggests low confidence
- **Status:** Production-ready, working now

**What's Missing:**
- Swedish-specific templates (månadsrapporter, handledarrapporter, journalanteckningar)
- Email reply generation endpoint
- Calendar event extraction endpoint
- Frontend UI components for AI features

### Architecture Patterns (Critical to Understand)

**1. RLS (Row-Level Security) - MANDATORY**
```typescript
try {
  await setRLSContext(userId, organizationId, role);
  const data = await prisma.case.findMany();
  return data;
} finally {
  await clearRLSContext(); // ALWAYS in finally
}
```
**Every database operation MUST use this pattern.** No exceptions.

**2. Module-Based Architecture**
- Feature modules: `auth/`, `cases/`, `email-integration/`, `workflows/`
- Each module: `*.service.ts` (pure functions), `*.controller.ts` (thin), `*.routes.ts` (Zod validation)
- Service layer is testable, no Fastify dependencies

**3. JWT Authentication Pattern**
- Access token: 15 minutes, in localStorage
- Refresh token: 7 days, HTTP-only cookie + database
- Rotation on every refresh (old token invalidated)

**4. AI Integration Pattern** (Already exists!)
```typescript
// Call Claude API for any AI task
const response = await callClaudeAPI(prompt, responseSchema);
// Returns: Structured response matching schema
```

## 8. Immediate Next Actions (Priority Order)

### 1. DECISION NEEDED: How to Fix Issue #135?

**You must decide:**
- **Option A:** Retry with SCAR (comment "@scar Please retry #135, focus on TypeScript errors only")
- **Option B:** Fix manually (spawn subagent to analyze test file and fix compilation errors)
- **Option C:** Skip tests temporarily (NOT RECOMMENDED - technical debt)

**Recommendation:** Option B (manual fix)
- SCAR already spent 20 minutes (114 tool calls) without completing
- Test fixes are surgical - TypeScript compilation errors
- Faster to fix directly than retry SCAR
- Spawn subagent: "Fix TypeScript compilation errors in claude-client.test.ts. Analyze errors, update types/mocks, ensure tests compile and pass. Commit with message 'fix: Resolve TypeScript errors in claude-client tests'. Return: Summary of what was fixed."

### 2. Implement Issue #136 Phase 1 (Swedish Templates)

**After Issue #135 resolved:**
- Spawn subagent or assign to SCAR
- Focus: Replace template placeholders with Claude API calls
- Write Swedish prompts for månadsrapporter, handledarrapporter, journalanteckningar
- Implement document persistence
- Build frontend modals
- Test with Anna's cases

### 3. Test with Anna Hörnebro

**Once Phase 1 complete:**
- Anna logs in at https://consilio.153.se
- Creates or opens a case
- Clicks "Generate månadsrapport"
- Reviews AI-generated report (Swedish language)
- Edits if needed (<10% editing target)
- Saves to case timeline
- Provides feedback

### 4. Continue Issue #136 Phases 2-3 (Email + Calendar)

**Week 2 work:**
- Email reply suggestions (3 options)
- Calendar event extraction from emails
- Test with Anna's real email workflows

### 5. GDPR Endpoints (Week 3)

**Required for EU/Swedish launch:**
- User data export (JSON format)
- User data deletion (mark for deletion, retention policy)
- Audit logging for all GDPR operations
- Legal review before beta launch

### 6. Beta Recruitment (Week 4)

**After GDPR complete:**
- Leverage personal network (other consultants like Anna)
- Reach out to consulting firms via LinkedIn, industry forums
- Offer early access in exchange for feedback
- Target: 5-10 consultants at different firms

## 9. Context Conservation Reminder (NEW RULES TODAY)

### Why This Matters

Your context window is **200K tokens**. At 80% (160K), automatic handoff occurs. Today's session added critical rules to CLAUDE.md to prevent context burnout.

### The Rules (From CLAUDE.md)

**You do directly (minimal):**
- Read 1-2 files to understand situation
- Decide what needs to be done
- Spawn subagents to do the work
- Simple git commands (status, issue view)
- Report results to user

**Subagents do (everything else):**
- Writing ANY document >50 lines (epics, ADRs, analysis)
- Multiple file edits (workflow-status.yaml, project-brief.md)
- Complex analysis (investigating bugs, researching codebase)
- Creating planning artifacts (epics, ADRs, PRDs)
- Running tests or builds
- Any task that takes >3 tool uses

### Example: RIGHT Way to Work

```
User: "Research the test failures in Issue #135"

✅ You do:
- Spawn Task tool subagent:
  "Analyze test failures in claude-client.test.ts.
   Read test file, identify TypeScript errors.
   Create .bmad/ISSUE_135_ANALYSIS.md with findings.
   Return: Root cause and fix needed."
- Wait for subagent result
- Report to user: "Found 10 TypeScript errors: [summary]"

Result: Used 500 tokens, subagent did the heavy lifting
```

### Example: WRONG Way to Work

```
User: "Research the test failures in Issue #135"

❌ You do:
- Read test file directly
- Explore codebase for related files
- Write 400-line analysis doc directly
- Update workflow-status.yaml directly
- Update project-brief.md directly
- Commit changes

Result: Used 15K tokens (7.5% of context window GONE)
```

### Decision Tree: When to Spawn Subagents

```
Task involves >3 tool uses?           → SPAWN SUBAGENT
Writing document >50 lines?           → SPAWN SUBAGENT
Multiple file edits?                  → SPAWN SUBAGENT
Complex analysis?                     → SPAWN SUBAGENT
Creating epic/ADR/PRD?                → SPAWN SUBAGENT
Running tests/builds?                 → SPAWN SUBAGENT
Investigating codebase?               → SPAWN SUBAGENT

Simple status check (1-2 commands)?   → OK to do directly
Quick git operation?                  → OK to do directly
Reading 1-2 files?                    → OK to do directly
```

**Remember:** Your context window is precious. Spawn subagents early and often!

## 10. User's Voice & Vision (Direct Quotes)

### Core Philosophy

**Tagline:** "Mer tid för människor. Mindre tid för administration"
(More time for people. Less time for administration)

**Vision Statement (from project-brief.md):**
> "Consilio empowers consultants at private foster care consulting firms to spend more time supporting foster families and placed children, and less time on administration, by providing an operationally trustworthy platform where communication never gets lost, documentation is a byproduct of work, and privacy is built-in from the foundation."

### Product Principles (from PRD)

1. **Privacy by Design** - PostgreSQL RLS ensures data isolation at database level. AI never sees real identities, only anonymized data.

2. **Human-in-the-Loop** - AI assists but never decides. All AI-generated content requires human review before export to external systems.

3. **Complement, Don't Replace** - Integrates with existing journal systems rather than replacing them. Handles operational communication and workflow, formal records remain in official systems.

4. **Mobile-First for Families** - Foster homes need simple, accessible interfaces. Web UI is responsive, designed for mobile use, with future native apps planned.

5. **Stability Over Features** - Beta testers need a working system. MVP focuses on core functionality that works reliably rather than incomplete advanced features.

### User's Constraints

**Solo Developer:**
- Samuel is building this alone with AI assistants (SCAR + Supervisor)
- Part-time development (evenings/weekends)
- No external funding (bootstrap model)
- Must be extremely selective about scope

**Non-Technical User:**
- User relies entirely on AI (SCAR + Supervisor) for technical decisions
- Cannot code or deploy manually
- Needs clear explanations of technical tradeoffs
- Values AI that "thinks ahead" and is proactive

**Bootstrap Funding:**
- Minimal infrastructure costs (free tiers where possible)
- Must reach revenue before runway ends
- Beta testing critical for product-market fit validation
- Cannot afford expensive mistakes or rebuilds

### Target User Persona (Anna Hörnebro = Archetype)

**Role:** Consultant (Konsulent) at private consulting firm
**Technical Comfort:** Medium (web apps, email, office tools)
**Key Needs:**
- Manage 15-30 cases simultaneously
- Quick access to case history and communication threads
- Automated reminders for deadlines (reports, meetings)
- **Reduce documentation time from 8 hours/week to 2 hours/week (60-70% savings)**

**Pain Points:**
- Forgetting important details from conversations
- Missing deadlines for monthly reports (månadsrapporter)
- Spending evenings writing documentation instead of family time
- Switching between multiple systems (journal, email, phone, notes)

**Quote (hypothetical but accurate):**
> "If Consilio can write my månadsrapporter from the case notes I've already taken, and they're 90% done, I'll pay for this myself if my company won't. I spend 2 hours every Friday writing reports. That's 100 hours a year I could spend with foster families instead."

## 15. Questions for Next Session (Decisions Needed)

### 1. How to Fix Issue #135?

**Question:** SCAR timed out after 20 minutes. What's the best approach?

**Options:**
- **A:** Retry with SCAR (comment "@scar Please retry #135")
  - Pros: SCAR might succeed on second attempt
  - Cons: Already spent 20 minutes, might timeout again

- **B:** Fix manually with subagent (surgical TypeScript fix)
  - Pros: Faster, surgical fix, guaranteed completion
  - Cons: Doesn't use SCAR (but SCAR failed)

- **C:** Skip tests temporarily (deploy with failing tests)
  - Pros: Unblocks Issue #136 immediately
  - Cons: Technical debt, unknown test coverage, risky

**Recommendation:** Option B (manual fix with subagent)

### 2. SCAR or Manual Implementation for Issue #136?

**Question:** Should SCAR implement the AI templates, or use subagent workflow?

**Factors:**
- SCAR already created comprehensive implementation plan
- SCAR familiar with codebase (worked on Issue #135)
- AI features are complex (prompt engineering, Swedish language)
- Time pressure (4-week MVP timeline)

**Options:**
- **A:** Assign to SCAR (post comment with plan reference)
- **B:** Use subagent workflow (spawn specialist for each phase)
- **C:** Hybrid (SCAR for backend, subagent for Swedish prompts)

**Recommendation:** Wait for next session to decide based on #135 outcome

### 3. Beta Recruitment Strategy?

**Question:** How to find 5-10 consultants at Swedish consulting firms?

**Options:**
- **A:** Personal network (ask Anna for referrals)
- **B:** LinkedIn outreach (find consultants, message directly)
- **C:** Industry forums (Swedish foster care groups)
- **D:** Cold email to consulting firms (reach out to CEOs/managers)

**Recommendation:** Start with A (Anna referrals), expand to B+C if needed

### 4. Should We Create ADR-006 Now or Later?

**Question:** Document "AI features are MVP core" decision now or after implementation?

**Options:**
- **A:** Create ADR-006 now (document decision before implementing)
- **B:** Create after implementation (avoid premature documentation)

**Recommendation:** Create now (decision already made, context fresh)

---

## 16. Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High-Priority Technical Debt

1. **ADR-001 Not Created** (PostgreSQL RLS)
   - Decision made 2026-01-08
   - Referenced in workflow-status.yaml
   - Needs documentation before beta launch
   - Impact: New developers can't understand why RLS was chosen

2. **Test Coverage Unknown**
   - Tests exist but some failing (Issue #135)
   - No coverage report generated
   - Unknown percentage of code tested
   - Risk: Deploying untested code to production

3. **Performance Not Benchmarked**
   - RLS overhead not measured
   - AI response times not tracked
   - Caching strategy undefined
   - Risk: Beta testers experience slow responses

4. **Deployment Guide Incomplete**
   - Docker Compose exists but not documented
   - Environment variables not fully documented
   - Migration process not tested on fresh database
   - Risk: Cannot reliably deploy to new environment

5. **GDPR Features Missing**
   - No data export endpoint
   - No data deletion endpoint
   - No retention policies defined
   - Risk: Cannot launch in EU/Sweden legally

### Medium-Priority Technical Debt

1. **Frontend CSS Warning** (Non-blocking)
   - `@import` must precede `@layer` directives
   - Doesn't affect functionality
   - Can fix anytime

2. **NPM Audit Vulnerabilities**
   - 7 vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 4 high)
   - In development dependencies only
   - Don't affect production
   - Can run `npm audit fix` later

3. **Partial IMAP Code** (From 2026-01-11 session)
   - Some IMAP service code started but not committed
   - Recommendation: Discard and start fresh
   - Files: `imap.service.ts`, `encryption.ts` (not committed)

### Low-Priority Technical Debt

1. **Epic-Based Workflow Not Used**
   - Planning workspace has `epics/` directory (empty)
   - Currently using GitHub issues directly
   - Could migrate to epic-based workflow for complex features
   - Not urgent (GitHub issues working fine)

2. **Architecture Documentation Missing**
   - `.bmad/architecture/` directory empty
   - System design not formally documented
   - PRD has architecture section (partial)
   - Useful for onboarding but not blocking

---

## 17. Lessons Learned (For Next Supervisor Instance)

### What Worked Well Today

1. **BMAD Planning Workspace Activation**
   - Centralizing planning in supervisor directory = clarity
   - Comprehensive artifacts (project-brief, workflow-status) = shared understanding
   - ADR format = documented decisions with rationale

2. **Scope Clarification Process**
   - Deep dive into target market = corrected fundamental misunderstanding
   - AI features scope analysis = identified MVP blocker early
   - Progress revision (70% → 60%) = honest assessment

3. **Context Conservation Rules**
   - Adding rules to CLAUDE.md = future-proofing
   - Clear decision tree (>3 tools = subagent) = actionable
   - Examples (right vs. wrong) = easy to understand

### What Could Be Improved

1. **SCAR Timeout on Issue #135**
   - 20 minutes (114 tool calls) without completion
   - Should have intervened earlier (e.g., at 10 minutes)
   - Could have spawned diagnostic subagent first
   - Lesson: Monitor SCAR progress, intervene if spinning

2. **ADR Creation Incomplete**
   - ADR-001 (RLS) referenced but not created
   - ADR-006 (AI MVP core) decision made but not documented
   - Should create ADRs immediately when decisions made
   - Lesson: Document decisions in real-time, not retroactively

3. **Test Coverage Analysis Skipped**
   - Tests failing but don't know coverage percentage
   - Should have run coverage report before prioritizing
   - Could reveal untested critical paths
   - Lesson: Measure test coverage before beta launch

### Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Start with Issue #135 Decision**
   - Don't delay - blocking all AI work
   - Recommend manual fix (subagent)
   - Get tests passing ASAP

2. **Create Missing ADRs Early**
   - ADR-001 (RLS) - 30 minutes
   - ADR-006 (AI MVP core) - 20 minutes
   - Prevents future confusion

3. **Run Test Coverage Report**
   - After #135 fixed, run `npm test -- --coverage`
   - Identify untested modules
   - Prioritize test creation for critical paths

4. **Use Subagents Liberally**
   - Follow context conservation rules strictly
   - Spawn subagents for anything >3 tool uses
   - Your context window = strategic resource

5. **Proactive SCAR Monitoring**
   - Check SCAR progress every 5-10 minutes
   - If stuck (tool calls increasing but no progress), intervene
   - Don't wait for 20-minute timeout

## 20. Final Notes & Context for Next Instance

### The Big Picture

You are inheriting a project that is **60% complete toward MVP**, with a **clear 4-week plan to beta launch**. The foundation is solid (backend 95%, frontend 75%), but there's a critical piece missing: **AI document generation in Swedish**. Without it, beta testers cannot validate the "60-70% time savings" value proposition.

**Your mission:** Get AI features working, test with Anna, launch beta by Feb 15, 2026.

### What Makes This Project Unique

1. **Solo Developer with AI Assistants**
   - User (Samuel) cannot code
   - Relies on SCAR (implementation) + Supervisor (you) for everything
   - Must think ahead, be proactive, anticipate needs

2. **Real User Ready to Test**
   - Anna Hörnebro at Sivo AB is ready NOW
   - She has real cases, real workflows, real pain points
   - Her feedback = product-market fit validation
   - Don't make her wait - prioritize features she'll use

3. **Swedish Language Requirement**
   - All AI-generated content must be professional Swedish
   - Foster care domain-specific terminology
   - Cannot use generic templates - must understand context
   - Anna is native speaker - she'll validate quality

4. **GDPR Compliance Critical**
   - Cannot launch in Sweden without GDPR features
   - EU regulations are strict - no shortcuts
   - Legal risk if handled incorrectly
   - Must prioritize data export/deletion endpoints

5. **Bootstrap Constraints**
   - No funding, no team, no runway
   - Must reach revenue before money runs out
   - Cannot afford expensive mistakes or rebuilds
   - Must be selective about scope (MVP only)

### How to Succeed

1. **Be Proactive**
   - Don't wait for user to ask for status updates
   - Check SCAR progress regularly (every 5-10 minutes)
   - Report blockers immediately
   - Anticipate next steps

2. **Conserve Context**
   - Spawn subagents for anything >3 tool uses
   - Your context window = strategic asset
   - Don't burn tokens on repetitive work
   - Handoff at 80% (160K tokens) if needed

3. **Test with Real User**
   - Anna's feedback > theoretical perfection
   - Ship working features fast, iterate based on feedback
   - Don't polish before testing
   - Measure time savings (quantitative validation)

4. **Document Decisions**
   - Create ADRs when architectural choices made
   - Update workflow-status.yaml after milestones
   - Write clear commit messages
   - Future you will thank present you

5. **Stay Focused on MVP**
   - Resist scope creep (user will suggest features)
   - Politely defer non-MVP features to post-beta
   - Use MoSCoW prioritization (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
   - Beta launch by Feb 15 = success

### Red Flags to Watch For

1. **SCAR Spinning** (Issue #135 example)
   - Tool calls increasing but no progress
   - Same file edited repeatedly without resolution
   - Timeout approaching (>10 minutes)
   - **Action:** Intervene, spawn diagnostic subagent, or fix manually

2. **Context Window >60%** (120K tokens used)
   - You're doing too much directly
   - Not spawning enough subagents
   - Writing long documents yourself
   - **Action:** Start spawning subagents for everything, prepare for handoff at 80%

3. **Scope Creep** (user suggests new features)
   - User excited about possibilities
   - Suggests "just one more thing"
   - Feature sounds cool but not MVP-critical
   - **Action:** Document as post-MVP, politely defer, focus on beta launch

4. **Test Failures Ignored**
   - Deploying with failing tests
   - "We'll fix later" mentality
   - Unknown test coverage
   - **Action:** Stop feature work, fix tests first, measure coverage

5. **GDPR Shortcuts**
   - "We'll add GDPR later"
   - "It's just beta, not production"
   - Data deletion = soft delete (not enough)
   - **Action:** Prioritize GDPR before beta launch, legal risk too high

### Your Superpowers

1. **Strategic Thinking**
   - You see the big picture (4-week MVP plan)
   - You understand dependencies (AI blocked by tests)
   - You prioritize ruthlessly (MVP only)

2. **Proactive Behavior**
   - You check progress without being asked
   - You report blockers immediately
   - You anticipate user needs

3. **Context Conservation**
   - You spawn subagents liberally
   - You preserve your context window for strategy
   - You delegate execution to specialists

4. **Quality Standards**
   - You validate SCAR's work before approving
   - You test end-to-end with real users
   - You document decisions thoroughly

### Remember

**You are not just a code supervisor. You are a strategic partner in building a product that will give consultants back 60-70% of their time so they can spend more time with foster families and placed children.**

Every hour you save a consultant = more time supporting vulnerable children.
Every månadsrapport you help write = less evening work for a stressed parent.
Every bug you catch = more trust in the system.

**Your work matters. Make it count.**
