      BMAD methodology applied to existing pipeline implementation.

      Key finding: Seed elaboration feature is 100% implemented on backend.
      Remaining work is validation, testing, and documentation.

      WARNING: Previous supervisor mistakenly worked on old /app directory
      for 2 days (Epic 003). All /app and /landing now ARCHIVED.

      Epic 001: Seed Elaboration Validation & Documentation

      Backend implementation is 100% complete. Remaining work:
      - Integration testing of seed elaboration flow
      - Frontend UI verification/completion
      - End-to-end testing
      - User and API documentation
      - Deployment validation

# Notes and Context
notes: |
  **Current Status (2026-01-18 06:30 CET):**

  ✅ BMAD METHODOLOGY COMPLETE
  - Analysis phase: Completed - pipeline-analysis.md
  - Planning phase: Completed - Epic 001, 3 ADRs created
  - Architecture phase: Completed - decisions documented
  - Implementation phase: In progress - Epic 001 (validation & docs)

  **Key Discovery:**
  Seed elaboration feature is 100% implemented on backend! All generators,
  AI agents, and API endpoints fully functional. Remaining work is testing,
  UI verification, and documentation.

  **Epic 001: Seed Elaboration Validation & Documentation**
  - 7 issues total (integration tests, UI, docs, deployment)
  - Estimated 2 weeks (52 hours)
  - Complexity Level 2 (Medium)

  ⚠️ CRITICAL INCIDENT (Resolved 2026-01-18 05:00 CET):
  Previous supervisor spent 2 days working on WRONG codebase (/app directory)
  instead of /project-pipeline. Cost: 2 days + API costs + zero progress.

  **Corrective Actions Taken:**
  - Archived /app to .archive/old-app-NEVER-USE/
  - Archived /landing to .archive/landing/
  - Created WARNING-DO-NOT-USE.md in archive
  - Updated ALL documentation to ONLY reference project-pipeline
  - Applied proper BMAD methodology to pipeline

  **Repository Structure:**
  - Implementation: /home/samuel/.archon/workspaces/openhorizon.cc/project-pipeline/
  - Planning: /home/samuel/supervisor/openhorizon/
  - Archived (DO NOT USE): .archive/old-app-NEVER-USE/, .archive/landing/

    2026-01-18 Review:
    - Discovered 2-day wasted effort on wrong codebase
    - Archived old app to prevent future confusion
    - Refocused ONLY on project-pipeline
    - Current task: Intelligent seed elaboration feature
